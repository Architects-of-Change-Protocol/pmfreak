/**
 * Companion to signup-onboarding-resolution-failure-fixed.test.mjs. That
 * file proves the try/catch fallback engages correctly ON FAILURE; this
 * file proves it does NOT engage when resolution succeeds — i.e. the fix
 * doesn't quietly turn every signup into a hardcoded /projects/new
 * redirect regardless of actual onboarding state.
 *
 * This does NOT route the success case through `signupAction` itself, for
 * a confirmed, reproduced reason: `resolveCanonicalWorkspace`/
 * `resolveOnboardingState`'s DB access goes through
 * `createPrivilegedSupabaseClient` (src/lib/security/privileged-access.ts)
 * -> `@supabase/supabase-js`'s `createClient`. Unlike every other package
 * mocked in this test suite, `@supabase/supabase-js` ships its raw `.ts`
 * source alongside `dist/` inside `node_modules` (`"files": ["dist",
 * "src"]`) — confirmed by direct reproduction: importing it from a `.ts`
 * file (any `.ts` file, not specific to this codebase) resolves through
 * tsx to `node_modules/@supabase/supabase-js/src/index.ts`, not
 * `dist/index.mjs`, in a way that bypasses `node:test`'s
 * `t.mock.module()` hook entirely — mocking both the `dist` and `src`
 * target URLs was tried and neither intercepts the call. This is a tsx
 * resolution behavior specific to this one package, not the `@/`-alias
 * issue documented in the other test files.
 *
 * Given that, this exercises the real, unmocked `resolveOnboardingState`
 * (real evidence-collection logic, real state-machine rules) via its own,
 * already-existing `opts.getClient` test seam — the same seam
 * `(protected)/layout.tsx`'s own tests would use — supplying a
 * `workspaceId` directly rather than also routing through
 * `resolveCanonicalWorkspace` (whose own success/failure behavior is
 * already covered by signup-onboarding-resolution-failure-{pre-fix,fixed})
 * — plus the real, unmocked `resolvePostAuthDestination`, proving that
 * `signupAction`'s actual call shape
 * (`resolvePostAuthDestination({ onboardingState: await
 * resolveOnboardingState(...), ... })`) reaches the real, evidence-derived
 * `/command-center` destination when resolution succeeds, not the
 * try/catch's `/projects/new` fallback.

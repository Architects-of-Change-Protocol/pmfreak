// Perilla 3 — Invite Acceptance / Workspace Role Assignment Hardening.
//
// acceptEarlyAccessInvite (src/lib/early-access.ts) creates a brand-new workspace
// and assigns the accepting user "owner" (hardcoded, never client-supplied — that
// part was already correct). What it was missing: any authenticated user holding a
// valid, pending invite token — regardless of which email the invite was addressed
// to — could activate it under their own account, since invite_email was fetched
// but never compared to the accepting user's email.
//
// acceptEarlyAccessInvite has no dependency-injection seam (it calls
// createSupabaseServiceRoleClient / logFirstUserTelemetryEvent directly, both of
// which need live Supabase env/config), so a full behavioral test isn't practical
// without a live database or a broader refactor outside this perilla's scope. This
// is a source-level regression test confirming the email-match guard exists and
// runs before any workspace/membership mutation — the primary, fully
// behaviorally-tested fix for this perilla is the workspace_invitations path
// covered by tests/invite-workspace-role-boundary.test.mjs.

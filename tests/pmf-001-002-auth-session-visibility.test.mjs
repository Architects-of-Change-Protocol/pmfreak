// PMF-001/PMF-002 correction pass — requirement 16: verify the new
// login/signup post-auth destination resolution does not assume a
// getAuthUser()/cookie-backed session read succeeds immediately after
// sign-in/sign-up in the same request.
//
// Design: signup/actions.ts and api/login/route.ts now build the identity
// used for resolveOnboardingState/resolveCanonicalWorkspace directly from
// the sign-in/sign-up call's own response (`data.user`), never from a
// subsequent getAuthUser() call. resolveOnboardingState and
// resolveCanonicalWorkspace both use the service-role Supabase client (keyed
// explicitly by userId), which does not read cookies at all — so neither
// function's correctness depends on whether next/headers' cookies() has
// propagated the freshly-set session cookie within the same request.
//
// This test proves both halves: (1) the source no longer calls
// getAuthUser() in either flow, and (2) real invocation of
// resolveOnboardingState with only a minimal {id, email} — exactly what a
// sign-in/sign-up response provides, with no cookie read involved — resolves
// correctly against a fake, non-cookie-backed client.

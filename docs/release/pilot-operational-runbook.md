# Pilot Operational Runbook — PMFreak Closed Beta

Perilla 11 deliverable. Audience: the pilot operator (currently the repo
owner). Everything here assumes the Vercel + hosted-Supabase deployment
topology enforced by `docs/security/production-deployment-boundary.md`.

## 1. Pre-deployment checklist

- [ ] `npm run check:beta-release` passes on the release commit (blocking
      gates all PASS; advisory gates at worst CONDITIONAL with every
      condition tracked in `residual-risk-register.md`).
- [ ] Pilot-blocker conditions cleared: RR-XLSX (SheetJS 0.20.3 installed),
      RR-MIGRATE (fresh-DB migration apply + `check:operational-flow-db`
      green on staging), RR-BACKUP (restore rehearsed).
- [ ] `docs/release/beta-release-gate-results.md` regenerated for the release
      commit.

## 2. Environment validation

- [ ] All server-only vars set in Vercel (production scope):
      `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`,
      `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID`, `STRIPE_PMO_PRICE_ID`,
      `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ABUSE_HASH_PEPPER` (real value, not default).
      **Under the closed-free-beta profile the `STRIPE_*` variables are not
      required and no billing surface is exercised** — see §6. They remain
      declared production-required by
      `src/lib/security/deployment-boundary-registry.ts`; that contradiction is
      narrowed but not eliminated (`RR-PRODUCTION-ENV-GUARD`, split out of the
      now-resolved `RR-BOOT-ENV-GUARD` because the beta and full-production
      environment contracts are not the same contract).
- [ ] **Closed-free-beta profile selected.** Set
      `PMFREAK_OPERATING_PROFILE=closed-free-beta` and start the runtime with
      `npm run start:closed-free-beta` (**not** a bare `next start`). That script
      runs `npm run check:beta-environment` first and refuses to start on any
      violation, printing `{"ok":false,"failureClass":"CONFIGURATION_FAILURE",...}`
      with the violation codes. It validates: profile selected, Supabase trio
      present, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` present **and a valid http(s) URL**, no
      secret-shaped `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` name, and the capability claim secret when
      governance is enabled. Stripe variables are **not** required.
      **A bare `next start` is UNSUPPORTED for the accepted local closed-beta
      path.** It bypasses the preflight entirely, and a runtime started that way
      is outside what P0-LAUNCH-05 accepted — do not use it, and do not treat a
      runtime started that way as having passed the beta environment contract
      (`RR-BETA-PREFLIGHT-BYPASSABLE`). There is still no in-process boot guard
      on either path — the beta contract is enforced by the start command
      (`RR-BETA-PREFLIGHT-BYPASSABLE`) and the full-production contract is not
      wired at all (`RR-PRODUCTION-ENV-GUARD`) — so the start command is the
      enforcement point.
- [ ] Public vars: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`,
      `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` (+ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` kept in sync) — real
      https URLs. The beta preflight above now rejects a malformed or non-http
      `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, which it previously did not. It does **not** reject
      a well-formed `http://localhost` origin, so **still confirm by hand that
      these point at the deployed origin**, and keep `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` in
      sync manually — it is not covered by the preflight.
- [ ] Optional guardrail tuning reviewed: `AI_*` limits, `LOG_LEVEL`,
      `HEALTHCHECK_DATABASE_TIMEOUT_MS`, `INVITE_TOKEN_TTL_HOURS`,
      `UPLOAD_MAX_*`. Unset = conservative defaults; invalid values fall back
      to defaults by design.
- [ ] `FOUNDER_EMAIL_ALLOWLIST` contains exactly the operator accounts.
- [ ] Pilot capability posture (Pilot Gate Sprint 01):
      `PMFREAK_GOVERNANCE_CAPABILITY_ENABLED` unset/false and
      `PMFREAK_CAPABILITY_PROFILE` unset for the pilot deployment (curated
      pilot surface; governance signing off — see
      `docs/release/pilot-capability-set.md`). `/api/ready` fails if the
      governance switch is on without `PMFREAK_CAPABILITY_CLAIM_SECRET`.
- [ ] `OPENAI_API_KEY` verified working (the copilot inference path fails
      hard without it — no canned fallback).

## 3. Database migration procedure

1. Snapshot first: confirm the latest Supabase backup is recent (Dashboard →
   Backups) or trigger one.
2. Apply migrations in filename order (Supabase CLI `supabase db push`, or
   the SQL editor for hosted-only setups). All Perilla-11 migrations
   (`20260820…`, `20260821…`, `20260822…`) are idempotent.
3. Post-apply verification queries:
   * `select column_name from information_schema.columns where table_name = 'workspace_invitations';`
     → must include `token_hash`, `revoked_at`; must **not** include `token`.
   * `select count(*) from public.ai_usage_events;` → table exists (0 rows).
   * `select relrowsecurity from pg_class where relname in ('ai_usage_events','dashboard_task_lifecycle_records');` → `t`.
4. `npm run check:db-contract` against the deployed commit.

## 4. Rollback procedure

* **Application:** Vercel → Deployments → promote the previous production
  deployment (instant). The Perilla-11 schema is backward-compatible with the
  previous app release *except* invite acceptance (the plaintext column is
  gone) — legacy invites were already revoked by design, so rollback keeps a
  working system where owners simply re-issue invites.
* **Database:** forward-fix only. If a migration misbehaves, write a
  corrective migration; restore from backup only for data corruption (see §8).

## 5. Health verification (after every deploy)

```
curl -s https://<app>/api/health   # 200, status:"ok", adapter list
curl -s https://<app>/api/ready    # 200, status:"ready"
```
Under `PMFREAK_OPERATING_PROFILE=closed-free-beta`, `/api/ready` reports **four**
checks — `configuration`, `governance_capability`, `database` and **`auth`**.
The `auth` check (added by P0-LAUNCH-05) probes GoTrue `/auth/v1/health` with the
anon key under the `HEALTHCHECK_DATABASE_TIMEOUT_MS` deadline. Outside that
profile the `auth` check is **absent from `checks` entirely** — the profile gate
is at the call site, not inside the check, so no `auth` entry is reported at all
rather than a passing one. A passing entry would silently widen the declared
dependency set for every non-beta consumer, which is why
`tests/observability-readiness.test.mjs` pins the non-beta set to exactly
`configuration`, `database`, `governance_capability`. So if you see **three**
checks and no `auth`, **the profile is not set** and you are not running the
beta posture.

`/api/ready` returning 503 names the failing check (config var *names*,
database reachability, or `auth` = `unreachable` / `timeout after Nms` /
`upstream <status>`) — fix env or Supabase before exposing traffic.
Readiness is **advisory**: a NOT READY instance still serves
(`RR-READINESS-NOT-A-GOVERNED-GATE`), so withdraw it from rotation yourself.
Then: log in with a pilot account, load `/command-center`, create a test
project, upload one small file, run one AI suggestion.

## 6. Billing mode confirmation

**Closed free beta: there is no billing.** Participants are on the free plan and
no charge is made. `npm run check:beta-environment` requires **no** `STRIPE_*`
variable, and P0-LAUNCH-05 focused-gate assertion 9 proves the beta environment
contract still passes with `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` both
absent.

- [ ] Confirm the beta is being run as **free** and say so to participants
      explicitly.
- [ ] If Stripe variables are set anyway, keep them in **test** mode. Never mix
      modes (`RR-STRIPE-ENV`).
- [ ] Only if a later pilot actually charges: use live-mode keys, configure the
      webhook endpoint with the deployed URL + matching `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`,
      send a test event and confirm a `billing_webhook_events` row.

## 7. Alerts & monitoring (manual cadence during pilot)

No external platform is integrated (RR-MONITOR). Instrumentation points:
structured logs (Vercel log drain-ready), `security_events`,
`workspace_audit_events`, `billing_webhook_events`, `ai_usage_events`,
`/api/ready`.

**Alert-worthy events** (check daily; each maps to a query or log filter):

| Event | Where to look |
| ----- | ------------- |
| Repeated auth failures / abuse denials | `security_events` (`abuse_rate_limited`, auth_denied types) |
| Billing webhook failures | Stripe dashboard events + `billing_webhook_events` gaps |
| Database connectivity failure | `/api/ready` 503s, Vercel function logs `readiness_check_failed` |
| AI provider failure spike / circuit-open | logs `circuit is open`, `ai_usage_events.status = 'error'/'timeout'` |
| Rate-limit spike | `abuse_rate_limits` counters, `security_events` |
| Service-role use anomaly | `security_events` `privileged_client_used` outside registry expectations |
| Failed privileged operation | `security_events` denial types |
| Migration failure | deploy-time output; `/api/ready` database check |
| Cost threshold reached | `ai_usage_events` daily sum vs `AI_DAILY_COST_LIMIT_USD`; guardrail denials log `daily_cost_ceiling` |

## 8. Backup / restore

1. Confirm plan tier includes daily backups (+ PITR if budget allows) on the
   pilot project.
2. **Rehearsal (pilot precondition, RR-BACKUP):** the logical-path drill was
   executed 2026-07-15 with full evidence (timings, integrity diff, RLS
   re-verification) — see `docs/release/backup-restore-drill.md` for the
   reproducible procedure. Remaining hosted step: restore the latest backup
   into a scratch Supabase project; point a preview deployment at it; verify
   login + one workspace loads. Record date + duration in
   `backup-restore-drill.md`.
3. Operational cadence during pilot: `pg_dump -Fc` before every migration
   deploy and at least daily (defines the logical-path RPO).
4. Real restore: same procedure; then rotate any keys that changed and update
   Vercel env; redeploy; run §5.

## 9. Incident response

1. Triage with §5 checks + Vercel logs (filter by `request_id` — `/api/ready`
   and SDK routes echo `x-request-id`).
2. Contain: for a suspected credential leak, rotate the affected key
   (Supabase service role / Stripe / OpenAI) in its console + Vercel env,
   redeploy (all sessions survive; service-role consumers pick up the new key
   on cold start).
3. **AI provider disable switch:** unset/void `OPENAI_API_KEY` in Vercel and
   redeploy — the provider registry reports `not_configured`, `runInference`
   fails closed with a clean error, and no route crashes. Cheaper large-blast
   alternative: set `AI_DAILY_REQUEST_LIMIT=1`.
4. **Rate-limit adjustment:** abuse limits are per-route constants (registry
   documents each); AI ceilings are env-tunable (`AI_DAILY_REQUEST_LIMIT`,
   `AI_MAX_CONCURRENT_PER_WORKSPACE`) — change env + redeploy.
5. Record the incident (what/when/blast radius/fix) in `docs/audits/`.

## 10. Pilot user provisioning & workspace creation

1. Founder grants early access (founder-only endpoints, Perilla 5) or the
   participant signs up directly (self-serve role is never privileged —
   Perilla 1).
2. Participant creates their workspace (owner membership is bootstrapped
   server-side) and invites teammates from `/team` — invite links are
   returned once at creation (hashed at rest, 7-day default TTL) and
   delivered out-of-band by the inviter (RR-INVITE-DELIVERY).
2b. **Operator-side admission** (P0-LAUNCH-05), when the operator admits a
   participant rather than a workspace owner doing it in-app:

   ```bash
   npm run beta:invite-participant -- \
     --workspace <workspace-uuid> --email <participant@example.com> \
     --role <pm|admin|viewer> --inviter <operator-email-or-uuid> \
     [--emit-accept-path]
   ```

   It runs the SAME invitation domain the `/team` action uses
   (`createWorkspaceInvitationRecord`), so duplicate rejection, the role gate
   ("owner" is never invitable), token hashing, TTL and the `invitation_sent`
   audit event are identical. The inviter must already hold owner/admin
   membership in that workspace. It refuses a non-local target outright.
   The plaintext token exists exactly once and is **withheld unless
   `--emit-accept-path`** is passed — pass it only when you must deliver the
   link, and deliver it out-of-band. The participant then accepts through the
   normal `/accept-invite/<token>` page.

   Note: the request-path governance-pipeline and seat checks resolve an
   authenticated HTTP user and therefore do NOT run on this path; the operator
   boundary authorises through the workspace actor role instead.
3. **Offboarding a participant** (P0-LAUNCH-05): `DELETE /api/workspace-team/members`
   with `{ workspaceId, targetUserId }`, as an owner or admin of that workspace.
   This removes the `workspace_memberships` row and writes a `member_removed`
   audit event carrying the previous role. It **removes tenant authority, not
   the identity** — the `auth.users` record is deliberately untouched. Refusals
   return 403 with a reason: `deny_self_removal` (you cannot remove yourself),
   `deny_last_owner` (the final owner cannot be orphaned),
   `deny_actor_insufficient_role`, `deny_target_not_member`. Authority is
   re-derived through Frontera per request, so a removed member's existing
   session retains no governed authority — proven live by P0-LAUNCH-03's
   out-of-process revocation scenario. Not yet exercised end-to-end against two
   live tenants; see the P0-LAUNCH-05 evidence document §9.
4. Weekly during pilot: review `ai_usage_events` per workspace (cost trend)
   and `workspace_audit_events` for anomalies.

## 11. Support contact

Pilot support is direct-to-operator: vicvalch@gmail.com (repo owner). Include
the `x-request-id` from any failing response when reporting.

## 12. Pilot shutdown procedure

1. Announce to participants; agree data handling per workspace.
2. Disable signups/invites: set `AI_DAILY_REQUEST_LIMIT=1` is NOT the tool —
   instead pause the Vercel deployment (or protect it behind Vercel
   authentication) so the app stops taking traffic.
3. Export any requested workspace data (operator SQL export — RR-EXPORT).
4. Final backup snapshot; archive `ai_usage_events` + audit tables.
5. Rotate all production secrets (they were exposed to pilot traffic).
6. Tear down or retain the Supabase project per retention commitments
   (backups expire per plan window — see data-recovery-readiness §G.5).

# P2-07 — Canonical Action-to-Task Adapter

## Prompt Metadata

- **Prompt ID:** P2-07
- **Work Package:** WP4
- **Title:** Canonical Action-to-Task Adapter
- **Phase:** Founder Invite
- **Primary Track:** Track A
- **Parallelizable:** no
- **Depends On:** P2-06 VERIFIED
- **Unlocks:** P2-08
- **Risk Level:** high
- **Expected Review Size:** medium
- **Status:** `VERIFIED`
- **Migration:** possible additive; forward-only, additive if used; destructive changes prohibited.

## Role

Act as the implementation owner for this bounded vertical increment. Read `../PMFREAK_PRODUCT_BASELINE_V2.md`, `../PMFREAK_FOCUSED_ASSESSMENT_P1.md`, and `../PMFREAK_SEQUENTIAL_BUILD_PLAN_P2.md` first. Preserve P0 target, P1 observed state, and ratified D1–D7. Start by recording branch, HEAD, working tree and applicable `AGENTS.md` instructions.

## Product Outcome

An allowed Action maps to one internal PMFreak Task contract while denied, revoked or unverified Actions cannot dispatch.

## Current State and Evidence

- **Reusable:** src/lib/task-drafts/; src/app/api/execution-tasks/; src/lib/operational-flow/; supabase/migrations/; tests/execution-tasks.test.mjs.
- **Partial:** P1 proves substantial components but no complete commercial chain.
- **Conflicting:** governed `operational_decision_records` coexists with legacy recommendation, `project_decisions`, task-draft and agent decision models.
- **Missing for this increment:** Adapt H5/H6 without direct Recommendation→Task semantics; define idempotency key, Action/Task references, internal provider port and no Outcome side effect.
- **Candidate adapters:** prefer existing services/ports in the listed areas; inventory consumers before adding a parallel model.

## Scope

Adapt H5/H6 without direct Recommendation→Task semantics; define idempotency key, Action/Task references, internal provider port and no Outcome side effect. End when this outcome is behaviorally tested and independently reviewable; do not absorb downstream prompts.

## Non-Goals

No broad redesign, external provider rollout, historical-model deletion, unrelated refactor, remote decision writeback, or implementation of later WP outcomes. Documentation alone is not completion.

## Dependencies and Preconditions

Required state: P2-06 VERIFIED. Every dependency must be `VERIFIED`; a contract-based parallel start is allowed only where metadata says so. Use an isolated development database for migrations/runtime tests. D1–D7 are ratified. Any fixture must say `DEMO / FIXTURE`, conform to the verified contract, and expire when P2-08 becomes verified. Inspect migration ordering and overlapping working-tree changes before editing.

## Canonical Contracts and Invariants

Source ≠ Raw Input ≠ Normalized Event ≠ Evidence; Finding ≠ Recommendation; Recommendation ≠ Decision; Decision ≠ Action; Action ≠ Task; Task completion ≠ Outcome achievement; business authority ≠ AOC policy decision; inference ≠ fact; Command Center is an experience/read model, not a hierarchy entity; tenant/workspace/project boundaries are explicit. Preserve stable IDs, explicit actor/evaluation timestamps, evidence references, lifecycle transitions and authority boundaries. Remote `allowDecisionWriteback` remains `false`.

## Implementation Requirements

1. Implement the scoped observable transition using preserve → connect → adapt → repair priority.
2. Reuse the cited components; add a compatibility adapter before any duplicate aggregate.
3. Make state transitions explicit, idempotent where retryable, and durable where material.
4. Carry `evaluatedAt`/occurred/recorded times, correlation and causation, provenance, confidence/missing data where applicable.
5. Inventory affected consumers and maintain compatibility; any migration is additive and RLS-aware.
6. Ensure fixtures cannot be returned or rendered as live data.

## Frontend / API / Domain / Data Implications

- **Frontend:** change only if required by outcome; consume verified contract; show loading/empty/error/denied/degraded and fixture label.
- **API:** server-validated scoped commands/queries; no composite command collapsing canonical transitions.
- **Domain:** contract/lifecycle change required only inside scope; retained models remain bounded.
- **Data:** migration `possible additive`; no destructive operation or silent dual-write. If temporary compatibility read/write is necessary, document owner, expiry prompt and reconciliation.
- **Compatibility:** future consumers use canonical references; legacy reads remain until safety gate proves replacement.

## AOC Boundary

AOC-P owns portable integrity/identity/capability primitives; AOC-E owns policy, authority, obligations, grants, delegation and revocation. PMFreak owns PM business objects. Use AOC-E in-process for Founder Invite when governance is applicable; remote mode is unavailable/advisory and must not write decisions. Persist only AOC reference/status/evidence projections. Fail closed for material actions and show unavailable/stale explicitly.

## Authorization, Tenancy and Security Requirements

Resolve server-side identity; verify Workspace membership, Project relationship and required role/authority; prevent IDOR by scoping every read/write; preserve RLS. Service role is allowed only via registered, justified narrow operations and never as user authorization. Add same-tenant positive and cross-tenant negative behavior tests. Attribute agent actions to verified agent and human/policy checkpoint when applicable.

## Events, Evidence and Audit Requirements

Emit/version domain event(s) with actor, tenant/workspace/project, occurred/recorded timestamps, correlation ID, causation ID, canonical and source references, material before/after state and applicable AOC policy/grant reference. Preserve Evidence/provenance and audit corrections; redact secrets, tokens, raw provider errors and restricted cross-tenant content.

## Error, Denied and Degraded States

Handle applicable validation, unauthenticated, forbidden/IDOR, stale context, missing evidence, unsupported legacy path, duplicate retry, partial persistence and provider failure. For governance paths also cover AOC denied, revoked, stale and unavailable. Never optimistically report success; make recovery/retry safe and visible.

## Testing Requirements

Add unit/domain and contract tests plus integration behavior for persistence and critical transition. Include authorization/tenancy negative, idempotency/retry, degraded/error and regression tests for reused components. UI scope requires component/browser coverage and accessibility. Source scanning may supplement but cannot be the only proof. Migration scope requires isolated DB/RLS verification.

## Acceptance Gates and Commands

Run, at minimum:

```bash
npx tsx --test tests/execution-tasks.test.mjs tests/execution-task-write-authorization.test.mjs
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
git diff --check
```

For migration/operational-flow scope also run `npm run check:operational-flow-db` against isolated infrastructure. For AOC scope run `npm run check:aoc-boundaries && npm run check:no-local-auth-bypass`. For UI/high-risk integration run `npm run build` and the repository browser/runtime scenario added by this prompt. Expected result: the Product Outcome is observable, negative/degraded cases pass, no unrelated regression occurs, and evidence is attached. Do not mark `VERIFIED` if an applicable command is skipped.

## Files Expected to Change

Expected areas: `src/lib/task-drafts/; src/app/api/execution-tasks/; src/lib/operational-flow/; supabase/migrations/; tests/execution-tasks.test.mjs`. Tests and narrowly scoped docs may change. Adjust paths only when better repository evidence is found and justify every deviation. Migration files, if needed, must be new and forward-only.

## Prohibited Changes

Do not enable remote writeback; delete/fuse legacy models; bypass AOC or membership/RLS; use zero/placeholder hashes; insert Evidence directly where Raw/Event is required; auto-create downstream canonical states; treat Task completion as Outcome; show fixtures as live; hardcode success; weaken tenant isolation; run destructive migration; redesign unrelated UI; or modify unrelated CI/dependencies.

## Required Delivery Report

Report status (`VERIFIED` only with all evidence), summary, files changed, migrations, contracts added/changed, exact tests/results, acceptance evidence/screenshots where applicable, deviations, known limitations, unlocked prompt, rollback/recovery instructions, compatibility/fixture expiry, and confirmation of no unrelated changes. Include branch/commit, diff summary and `git diff --check`.

## Stop Conditions

Stop as `BLOCKED` if a dependency is not `VERIFIED`; a non-ratified human decision or unavailable credential/infrastructure is required; migrations conflict; working-tree changes overlap; authorization would need weakening; canonical AOC contract cannot be determined; existing tests contradict P0 without authority; or scope exceeds this prompt. Use `IMPLEMENTED_NOT_VERIFIED` only when code exists but an acceptance command/environment remains incomplete; never continue a dependent prompt from that state.
